# Air-Canada-Seat-choice-prediction

Description of the challenge

Air Canada offers passengers the option to pre-select seats in the economy cabin, including Preferred (PREF) and Advanced (ADVS) seats, with different pricing models based on seat location and fare types. Customers' seat selection behaviors vary depending on factors such as seat prices, availability, flight routes, and travel purposes (business or leisure). The challenge is to predict customer behavior in selecting seats based on these variables.

What you will accomplish

Develop a predictive model to accurately forecast customers' seat purchase decisions (ADVS, PREF, or no purchase) based on key factors like pricing strategy, seat availability, trip details, and customer preferences. The winning solution will be the one that best identifies and predicts the relationship between these factors and customer behavior.
